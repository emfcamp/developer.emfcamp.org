There is a weather station attached to a mast at HQ.
Various sensor readings are pushed to MQTT topics listed below every ten seconds.

The broker is at `mqtt://mqtt.emf.camp` (more info on the [MQTT broker](/mqtt/) page).
The prefix for each topic is `emf/weather/`.

* `tempin`: Temperature in the HQ cabin in degrees Celsius.
* `humidityin`: Humidity in the HQ cabin in %RH.
* `baromabs`: Pressure reading in millibars.
* `temp`: Outdoor temperature in degrees Celsius.
* `humidity`: Outdoor humidity in %RH (must be above 40).
* `winddir`: Wind direction in degrees.
* `windspeed`: Wind average speed in miles per hour.
* `windgust`: Wind gust speed in miles per hour.
